I am extremely grateful to have been interviewed by Elsa Hahne, Director of Research Communication for the LSU Office of Research and Economic Development. In the interview we discuss a range of topics from the role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), common misconceptions about AI in academia and the broader public, and finally beignets. Simply because in Louisiana, we cannot forget about the beignets!
