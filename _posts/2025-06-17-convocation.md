Today, I am extremely honored to be the recipient of the George B. Walker Award for Best Doctoral Thesis for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta @UAlberta!

When I first learned that I was selected to receive this award, I was equal parts thrilled and curious; the latter feeling caused me to question the story behind the specific name of the person associated with this award as opposed to a more boilerplate award title like PhD Outstanding Thesis Award.

The resultant history lesson made me value my time at the University of Alberta ECE Department even more! 

George B. Walker, chair of the UAlberta ECE Department from 1964 to 1974, is credited with expanding the scope of the department from one that not only focused on undergraduate teaching, but one that also places a high value on excellent graduate-level research. Decades later, this department carries on his legacy and vision as a top institution for computer engineering and science research in North America! 

I am extremely grateful to my advisor Prof. Di Niu for guiding me along this journey as well as the dissertation committee that nominated my thesis (now available here: https://lnkd.in/gMs-_4Wa) for this highest of honors! Thank you again Profs. Scott Dick, Jun Jin, Linglong Kong, Shaolei Ren and Xingyu Li! Also thank you Dept. Chair Yunwei Ryan Li and Associate Dean Manisha Gupta!

Monday and Tuesday marked the true conclusion of my studies at the University of Alberta with a bang! I finally got to don what I like to nickname the "Jedi Master Attire" that is a Ph.D. graduation gown and celebrate with my family and friends! Thanks everyone for your unwavering love and support along the way!
