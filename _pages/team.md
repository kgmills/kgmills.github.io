**Recruiting**

At the moment, I have a checklist of **three** items for prospective students:

1) In the subject line of your email, mention the name of my research group at LSU CSE

2) In the body of your email, explicitly mention what topic you are interested in working on and how I am a good fit to be your advisor on that topic.

3) Before hitting send, read <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/baggili_phd-graduateschool-academia-activity-7417015846474153984-DxtE/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB8vwT0BxUvELhKw3qS9h5i_NJ3R4dt-2Xg">this wonderful post by the LSU CSE Chairman,</a> Dr. Abe Baggili, as well as the comment I left on the post. Then, revise your email to incorporate the tips and avoid pitfalls.
